- In this project, I'll scrape https://github.com/topics
- We'll get a list of topics. For each topic, I'll grab the topic title, topic URL and the topic description.
- The top 30 repositories for each topic page will be included.
- The repository name, username, stars and URL of each repository will be retrieved.
- I'll save the extracted information in a CSV file.
